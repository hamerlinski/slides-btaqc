# Course completion rules
## Blockchain Technology And Quantum Computation
* Exercises during classes and work in the classroom + tests/quiz.
* Project.

Lessons typically will start with topic introduction. Then students will perform small and simple tasks which will be reviewed and graded before end of class.

$$
\begin{array}{c}

\mathbb{X} = 0.3 \times\mathbb{E} + 0.7 \times\mathbb{P} \\
\tt where\,\, \mathbb{E}\,\, means\,\, average\,\, from\,\, excercies,\\
\tt and\,\, \mathbb{P}\,\, means\,\, grade\,\, from\,\, the\,\, project

\end{array}
$$

<br>

Each of the components of the grade must be positive.

# Project requirements
## Blockchain Technology And Quantum Computation

**Simple Blockchain Implementation**<br>
**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to implement a basic blockchain structure that can be used to store and verify transactions. The blockchain should include the necessary components such as blocks, transactions, and cryptographic mechanisms to ensure data integrity and security.

**Projects can be done alone or in groups of 2.**

# Project requirements
## Blockchain Technology And Quantum Computation
**Requirements:**
- The blockchain should be implemented using a programming language of your choice - no restrictions.
- The blockchain should support the addition of new blocks containing transaction data, which should be stored securely.
- The blockchain should use cryptographic mechanisms such as hashing and digital signatures to ensure the integrity and security of the data. Cryptographic mechanisms such as hashing can be achieved with external libraries like OpenSSL.
- The blockchain should support consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake to ensure the validity of the blocks.

# Project requirements
## Blockchain Technology And Quantum Computation
**Requirements:**<br>
05. The blockchain should include a simple user interface to allow users to add and view transactions, and to view the current state of the blockchain.<br><br>
06. The blockchain should include basic security features such as authentication and access control to prevent unauthorized access to the blockchain.<br><br>
07. The blockchain should be tested and evaluated for its performance and security.

# Project requirements
## Blockchain Technology And Quantum Computation

**Deliverables:**
- Source code for the blockchain implementation.
- A report, written using $\LaTeX$, describing the implementation, including design decisions, implementation details, and test results.
- A short, 5 minutes, demonstration of the blockchain implementation, including adding transactions, verifying blocks, and viewing the blockchain state.

**All of above should be comitted to public repository before last meeting.**
